# FurcDreamer

Description

A new open-source dreamweaver for Furcadia. Please note that this is in pre-alpha, and is not even close to being done yet. I just started this project and will take awhile to complete. Feel free to contribute a patch, if you'd like.


This will also make use of the excellent Furcadia Framework located here: https://furcadia.codeplex.com, the source of as of version 0.2.12 is included because I wanted to modify the source for use throughout this app.
